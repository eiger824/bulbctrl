BulbCtrl - A simple linux kernel driver and userspace program to control
the current flow of a USB-bulb for the Raspberry Pi 3!

This driver sets listens for interrupts on GPIO 23 (or number 16 in physical
notation), and whenever an interrupt is sensed, i.e. by pressing the button, it
sets GPIO 24 (or number 18 in physical notation) HIGH, so current flows through
the bulb.

The circuit schematic could be drawn as following:

                            --------

Pushbutton X is what is going to trigger the interrupt.
